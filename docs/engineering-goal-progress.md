# Zeluna Engineering Goal Progress

## Background

本文件记录 Zeluna 从当前快速播放基线推进到产品级工程状态的可复现证据。AniCh 材料仅用于理解架构思路；项目不得依赖 AniCh API，也不得保存其真实播放 URL、域名池、Cookie 或采样结果。

### Initial validation

- Flutter focused playback tests: 109 passed.
- Server focused tests: 39 passed.
- Commands:
  - `flutter test test/anime_controller_playback_hedge_test.dart test/playback_line_display_test.dart test/rule_playback_resolver_test.dart test/zeluna_backend_playback_repository_test.dart test/playback_prefetch_cache_test.dart --reporter compact`
  - `python -m unittest tests.test_aggregator tests.test_v3_services -q` (from `server`)

## Scope and rules

- Follow stages G0 through G14 in order and keep one auditable commit per coherent stage.
- Preserve current fast playback behavior; do not tune playback concurrency or ranking without regression evidence.
- Never commit secrets, production databases, real signed media URLs, third-party cookies, packet captures, or private signing material.
- Production deployment, account operations, destructive migrations, and other external state changes require separate authorization.

## G0 Fast-start freeze

Status: completed

Audit:

- Confirmed that both Python and Dart classifiers treated the first `mdat` as tail-moov.
- This misclassified fragmented MP4 (`moof -> mdat`) and incomplete byte ranges.
- Existing tests already protect stale-cache immediate return, quick/full refresh separation, single-flight refresh, prefetch reuse, tail-moov fallback behavior, playback progress retention, first-frame/stall/recovery conditions, and HLS first-segment verification.

Changes:

- Python and Dart now classify classic MP4 only from provable `moov`/`mdat` ordering.
- Fragmented samples containing `styp`/`moof`, incomplete tail evidence, and unknown containers remain `unknown`.
- Client verification preserves an already-known startup profile when its own sample is inconclusive.
- Playback prefetch writes are guarded by cancellation and account-context revision.

Tests:

- MP4 matrix covers fast-start, tail-moov, fragmented MP4, `moof -> mdat`, incomplete Range, unknown container, HLS, and DASH.
- Database round-trip preserves `startup_profile` and `startup_latency_ms`.
- Explicit regressions cover cancelled prefetch writeback, account-switch isolation, stable equal-score ordering, quick/full separation, stale cache, single-flight, tail-moov fallback, and prefetch reuse.
- `flutter test --reporter compact`: 458 passed, 26 intentionally skipped.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -q`: 74 passed.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Builds: deferred to the cross-platform release gates in G13/G14; G0 changes no build or signing configuration.

Commit: `test: freeze fast-start playback behavior` (this stage commit)

Remaining risks:

- Deterministic tests do not measure current third-party network quality; that evidence belongs to release/production acceptance.
- Playback ranking and concurrency parameters are frozen after this stage unless a reproducible regression requires a change.

## Acceptance principle

Only mark a stage complete when its implementation, tests, build evidence, commit, and remaining risks are recorded here. A passing HTTP status alone is not playback evidence; media validation must reach a valid manifest/container and a readable first media segment where applicable.
